Curling app
     the purpose of this app is to create a game of curling between two players on diffrent browsers using socket.io
     you can have multiple players but only two at a time can control the stones and the rest are spectators

Built with:
  this app uses node.js and the socket.io npm module
  
Installing:
  going to the main directory and typing npm install will install all the required modules.
 
Running:
   once all modules have been installed you can start the server with npm start. once started the terminal will give you a url to go to.
   openeing two browsers to this adress will let you play a game of curling once you hit "join game".
